# shadowpass
The other approach for passwords (making it dynamic depending on actual time)!

In short answer the shadowpass thing is "coding" password depending on time, and you can still figure out how it looks!

Well, to make it dynamic, you can make some sort of loop on your server or elsewhere you want to use it!

This project will always be open to read the code!
