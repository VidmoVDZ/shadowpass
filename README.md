# shadowpass
The other approach for passwords (making it dynamic depending on actual time)!

In short answer the shadowpass thing is "coding" password depending on time, and you can still figure out how it looks!

Well, to make it dynamic, you can make some sort of loop on your server or elsewhere you want to use it!

This project will always be open to read the code!

# How idea came?
Well, in life of some crazy people there is some thunderbolt that hits their head really hard. So they get attack of idea in their head. Dynamic passwords idea came just randomly to my head. It's something like Google authenticator but it's not generating random numbers or letters just bc it want to. It ONLY seems random but still you can figure out what the f*ck is going on with this password. Depending on actual time the password is another string. If you like thunderbolt idea attack feel free to check last heading (i will really be thankful for your even small support <3)
